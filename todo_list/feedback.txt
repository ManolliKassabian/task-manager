first:i used react_bootstrap directly instead of bootsrap to make the code much easier to write components and to understand
second:i had issues with deleting tasks but with debugging i managed to solve it due to id problem in the console
third:all the tasks needed for this assignment works well

difficulties:
    I encountered some difficulties in rearranging the code into multiple components as I intended,
    mainly due to the constraints of my work schedule and ongoing university projects.
    I hope you understand.
